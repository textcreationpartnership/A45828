            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:35882:4"/>the leaſt with ſuch a perſon: and though we are ſo unhappy as to differ, not only about this point of Reordination, but alſo about that other of general Admiſsion; yet theſe making no breach in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſtianity, ſhall make no breach, on my part, in the bonds of fraternal charity: Nay this I hope, that peaceable humble ſpirits will promote charity by the candid management of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, whilſt proud and peeviſh ſpirits waſte theirs about the very punctilio's of their unities. A judicious pious perſon without paſsion or faction, a Chriſtian Catholick without a party, is a Phenix no leſſe excellent then rare: Many have taught this way, but few have trod it, and fewer will there be, when the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Evangelical terms of peace ſhall be ſlighted, and new unneceſſary additionals ſhall be advanced. But yet if any ſhall break peace with me, as an impoſsibility, or illegality on their falſe terms, yet I will keep peace with them, if poſsible, on
<pb facs="tcp:35882:4"/>better terms.

But if our Succeſſors be inſufficient or ſcandalous, to the hazarding of immortal ſouls, what ſhall we do then? Not preach up rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, or faction, or the like; there is no Queſtion; but the Queſtion is, Whether we ſhould not preach the eſſential Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Chriſtianity, as that there is a God, a Saviour, a Heaven, a Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the neceſſary practices of faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and good works? And though
<pb facs="tcp:35882:7"/>we cannot do it in one Church, whether we ſhould not do it in another? And if we cannot in any publick place, whether we ſhould not privately from houſe to houſe? The Reaſons which ſpeak at preſent againſt our eaſe, are theſe.

                  <p>Containing certain Propoſitions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many are preſuppoſed in the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and granted, though not by all men, yet moſtly by the perſons that are chiefly concerned in the Queſtion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. IT is preſuppoſed that Jeſus Chriſt being Lord over all, hath inſtituted and ordained the office of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, determined his work, deſcribed his qualifications, impowered certain perſons to ſet ſome apart to this office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the converting of ſinners, and the edifying of his body Myſtical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Its to be underſtood that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35882:11"/>is not a meer political Miniſter, but an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Presbyter (for ſo you muſt give me leave to call him) nor a meer Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but a Preaching Presbyter, yet not one that rules over Presbyters; neither is it to our purpoſe to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſuch Ruling Elders or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſans by divine inſtitution, or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. It is to be preſuppoſed that Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit doth qualifie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſons, and encline to undertake, and enable to diſcharge this Miniſtry; and that the perſon in the Queſtion is ſuch a one, and that his former ordination was not vacated through the want of any neceſſary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. It is preſuppoſed that no man takes this honour to himſelf, but that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons qualified are to be ſolemnly ſet apart, or ordained to this office; and that the perſon in the Queſtion doth <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as much; or elſe to what purpoſe doth he trouble himſelf about Reordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. It is to be underſtood that this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial ordination is the ſolemn inveſting of a perſon qualified with Miniſterial power, after and with examination, approbation, benediction and impoſition of hands, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35882:11"/>that the perſon in the Queſtion hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo much from the Presbyterie; and that the fault lies not in the defect of any of theſe acts. Here (I confeſſe) is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more doubtful, as whether the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters ordination be an ordination? but this I leave to others who have ſpent more paper upon this Queſtion, then upon the other of Reordination: as alſo it ſeems doubtful to ſome, whether ordination be an inveſtiture with Miniſterial power? This more directly lying in my way, I ſhall endeavour to remove, before I ſtep one foot further. I find ſome that would make Ordination but a confirmation or teſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Miniſterial Call. Thus that learned Caſuiſt <hi>Baldwin,</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35882:12"/>Miniſter already, and to be it ſelf but a meer ſolemnity, as the coronation of an heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Prince; then there is not ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal to that ordinance, which may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its repetition: but let us not ſo ſlight ordination before we hear what others ſay.<note place="margin">Sum. in ſupplem. ad 3. part. p. 41. in Sentent.

               <p>Lo here you ſee are two ſorts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; and what ſhall we do with them? We will reſolve to reverence them both, but pin our faith on the ſleeves of neither. I proceed therefore to enquire into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ordination: And here I grant, what indeed cannot be denyed.
<list>
                     <item>1. That Jeſus is the principal Conſtituent of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power or office, and he is moſt properly the Ordainer, and his Act is moſt properly ordination.</item>
                     <item>2. That the Goſpel-Charter is the Inſtrument to convey this power.</item>
                     <item>3. That a perſon qualified with eſſential qualifications at leaſt, is the only Recipient of this power.</item>
                     <item>4. And may I not add That ordination is ſuch an ingredient (call
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35882:13"/>it by what name you will) that where it is rightly put, there is Miniſterial power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed; and where it is not put, there is not, there cannot be regularly any conveyance?</item>
                  </list>
So that you may call ordination either a ſolemn-publick Approbation, Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Teſtification, or allowance, with ſome; or a poteſtative Miſſion, ſolemn Inveſtiture, Collation, the eſſence of the external Call (which external and internal Call I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand much like to their external and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant) with others; or what elſe you think fit; and I ſhall not quarrel with you about words, provided it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that it hath the force of a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or <hi>cauſa ſine qua non.</hi> And though I might, with ſome, challenge more, as due to ordination, yet I chooſe rather to content my ſelf with thus much, leaſt catching at a ſhadow (with the Animal in the Fable) I ſhould loſe the ſubſtance. And if I can but prove that ordination is thus much, <hi>i. e.</hi> that which being rightly put, office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power will follow; and that which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, the conveyance of power (according to the order of the Charter) is ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this will be ſufficient to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. It is ſuppoſed that this work of ordination, is committed to certain perſons ordained themſelves to the ſame office at leaſt; and that the perſon in the Queſtion was ordained (as you muſt give me leave to call it) to the office of a Presbyter by the Presbytery, or Presbyters validly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained themſelves; and that our Queſtion now is not about the Ordainers own ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be Presbyters, or the Magiſtrates allowance of ſuch ordinations, at leaſt a <hi>poſtfacte,</hi> or the peoples conſent to ſuch Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. Let us ſuppoſe that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ordaining were neither heretical, ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, nor ſcandalous, though poſſibly they ordained in heretical, ſchiſmatical, and ſcandalous times, but were orthodox, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and pious (as many of them may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be judged to be) or at leaſt that they were not ſuch as by their perſonal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages to null their acts; and this we may well ſuppoſe, becauſe it is known, that Proteſtants and Papiſts do generally agree, that ordinations made by Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks, are not, <hi>to nomine,</hi> null and void.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:35882:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 8. It is ſuppoſed that the former ordination received, was an ordination to the office in the Catholick Church; and likewiſe that the latter ordination impoſed is to the ſame office in the Catholick Church; and that the Queſtion is not now about any particular inferiour ſeparation to a particular work, or exerciſe of an office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 9. It may be ſuppoſed, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon formerly ordained by the Presbytery, either knew not in thoſe cloudy times where to find a Dioceſan, or knowing, durſt not uſe him for fear of the Uſurpers; or deſiring ordination from him, he durſt not grant it; and ſo he looked upon himſelf as lying under a neceſſity to receive Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 10. It is ſuppoſed that the perſon ordained in this caſe of neceſſity, is ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to the validity of ſuch ordination, though not poſſibly as to the regularity, and that he dare not now diſown it, nor his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer acts done by vertue of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may ſpare that great pains that ſome have taken for the proof of the validity of Presbyterian ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 11. It is ſuppoſed, that if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ordination were valid in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35882:18"/>of the perſon in the Queſtion, then the denyal thereof, and the impoſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordination, muſt needs ſeem very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in his judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 12. It is ſuppoſed that the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the lawfulneſs of Reordination is not to be meaſured by the laws of men, but by the Laws of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 13. It is ſuppoſed that ſome things may be ſubmitted to in a caſe of neceſſity, which without that neceſſity may not; and as the perſon in the Queſtion would have the neceſſity of his <hi>quondam</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Presbyterian Ordination conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by his Cenſors; ſo undoubtedly that perſon himſelf ſhould conſider the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others in their preſent ſubmiſſion to Prelatical reordination; which neceſſity (to ſpeak ingenuouſly) will excuſe <hi>à tanto,</hi> if not <hi>à toto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 14. It is ſuppoſed, that ſome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours deny the former ordination, and forbid the further exerciſing of, or at leaſt deny encouragement to ſuch perſons as have that ordination only; and this is that which gives life to this Queſtion, which might otherwiſe have ſlept in oblivion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 15, It is ſuppoſed that a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of former ordination will not ſatisfie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35882:19"/>Superiours, nor any thing elſe beſides a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ordination by a Dioceſan; this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears, in that the Biſhop uſeth the ſame Queſtions, Forms, and Ceremonies in the reordaining of one that was ordained before, as he uſeth in the ordaining of one never yet ordained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 16. It is ſuppoſed that the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reordination, though it may be called an hypothetical reordination, yet it is abſolute in the judgement of the Impoſers, yea and abſolute in the form of adminiſtration (for ought I hear) by the Reordainers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 17. It is ſuppoſed, that though the Receivers of reordination may fancy it to be only accumulative (if there can be ſuch a thing) yet it is plainly deſtructive of their former ordination in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reordainers; and whether it be ſo in it ſelf, is hereafter to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

Do you well conſider, that what is reordination to the perſon in the Queſtion, is one and the ſame with the ordination of others not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained before? and ſo denying that to be an ordinance, do you not deny the other, and ſo run your ſelves upon a rock, that would ſplit both Church and Miniſtery, and expoſe your ſelves to the laſh of all men, except Papiſts and Browniſts?</item>

But if you ſay, that this Act, in reference to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained, is an Ordinance, being ordination; in reference to the ordained is no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, being reordination: Oh then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I beſeech you, what ſad work you make with Chriſts Ordinance; the ſame Act muſt be an Ordinance and no Ordinance at your pleaſure; the nature, end, and uſe muſt all be changed to ſerve your turn: As if it were like the Camelion that can change

If two diſtinct beings, then are there not two Miniſters in one perſon?

               <p>Though it is readily acknowledged, that ordination is in ſtrict and proper ſpeech no Sacrament (though many things in lax diſcourſe were formerly, and are ſtill called Sacraments) nor Seal of the Covenant of Grace, as Baptiſme, being not extended (no not in <hi>potentia</hi>) to all ſincere Covenanters;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35882:22"/>neither is there any element inſtituted for an outward ſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet may we not reckon their agreement in theſe. As Baptiſme is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn admiſſion into viſible Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, ſo is ordination into viſible Church-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and as the perſon baptized had a remote right before baptiſme; ſo the perſon ordained being duly qualified, &amp; providentially called; and yet as before baptiſme the perſon could not regularly partake of the Lords Supper, preſent an Infant to baptiſme, or the like; ſo before ordination the perſon qualified can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not regularly baptize, adminiſter the Lords Supper, or the like. Now the Queſtion is; If we cannot admit a new inveſtiture with Church priviledges by rebaptization, how ſhall we admit a new inveſtiture with Church-power by reordination? What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be brought from the nature of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting ſolemnity againſt rebaptization, which may not be brought againſt reordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

               <p n="5">5. Whether doth ordination beget a new

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35882:47"/>of Commentators never dropped from their pens.

For how can this juſtifie a twofold ordination by men? Or if they had a twofold ordination, the one extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, the other ordinary, can that juſtifie a twofold ordinary conſecration? Again, if the immediate ſending of theſe Apoſtles hold forth any thing to us, is it not anſwered by Chriſts gifting and inclining perſons to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this office, which is Chriſts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate work? and is by ſome called the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Call; and then our ordination by men anſwers the ſuppoſed ordination in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. And <hi>Acts</hi> 11. and then where is the third ordination to be found, to juſtifie this third Call (if with others I may ſo ſpeak) or fourth perchance exacted from us?</p>

Mr. <hi>H.</hi> p. 32, 33, 34. <hi>The reaſon of a precept is to be looked on as a precept; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a precept againſt the reaſon of it, is to break it; to do according to the reaſon, though not according to the precept, is to keep it. We have no precept in Scripture for reordination, but we have here in this inſtance</hi> (Acts 13.) <hi>the reaſon of it. Let any one tell me the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this impoſition of hands upon</hi> Paul <hi>by</hi> Lucius <hi>and</hi> Niger, <hi>who could not be made a Miniſter by man, ſeeing Chriſt had appeared to him (as it is ſaid) for that purpoſe before, and I will preſume to give the like or the ſame for our reordination by the Biſhop—What then is the reaſon indeed hereof? is it to give the Miniſterial office, and nothing elſe? ſurely
<pb facs="tcp:35882:51"/>if it does that at all—yet is not this the reaſon altogether for certain, becauſe there is an inſtance to the contrary, let any man cavil at it what he can. What then is the reaſon? why really I think it is this, this ſolemn rite doth give the currant repute, or valuation to a man of a Miniſter, ſo that he who was truly called of God before, is now received as ſuch by all, as to the exerciſe of his function with freedom and acceptation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Though in this ſubtile diſcourſe there are many notable excreſcencies of an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fancy, yet this crafty device of a new end to ordination to prevent prophanations, ſeems unto me the Monarch of all. Yet I think I may ſay of this as well as the reſt, <hi>acutile ſonant, ſed jacta reperiuntur obtuſa.</hi> In order to the diſcovery whereof I would firſt ſhew what are the true ends of that action, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. And ſecondly, that a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like allowance was not likely to be the end, whatever was. The ends mentioned are theſe three.
<list>
                     <item>1. This action tended to a ſolemn diſmiſſion of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> from the great work at <hi>Antioch.</hi> That they were engaged at <hi>Antioch,</hi> appears by thoſe words, v. 2. <hi>As they miniſtred to the Lord and faſted;</hi> their diſmiſſion appears in thoſe words, ver. 3. <hi>When they had faſted and prayed, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35882:52"/>laid their hands on them, they ſent them away.</hi> Hence <hi>Piſcator</hi> cals this <hi>forma dimiſſionis.</hi>

                           <hi>Piſcator</hi> in Acts 13.3.</note> So that indeed this action ſeems to be a vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory diſmiſſion of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> by the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> from their work there.</item>
                     <item>2. This action ſeems to be a ſolemn ſeparation of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the Apoſtolical work among the Gentiles, from <hi>ver. 2.</hi> Its ſaid by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Separate me</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>for the work whereunto I have called them.</hi> And that this work was the Miniſtry among the Gentiles, is evident from their diſcharge of this work, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. &amp; 14.</item>
                     <item>3. This action was intended as a recommendation of the Apoſtles to the grace of God, for the aſſiſting, protecting and ſucceeding of them in the work to which they were ſeparated, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 14.26.</item>
                  </list>
                  <hi>And thence ſailed to</hi> Antioch, <hi>from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.</hi> So then here you have from Scripture three ends of this action, <hi>diſmiſſion, ſeparation,</hi> and <hi>recommendation,</hi> but not the leaſt ſyllable (as I obſerve) that holds forth a proper ordination to theſe ends; for indeed it was not needful thereto, nor yet the leaſt ſyllable as holds forth any ſuch a fourth end as publikè allowance: And whoſoever
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35882:52"/>ſhall well conſider the eminency of the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where the Diſciples were firſt called Chriſtians, and the eminency of the ſervice that the Apoſtles had done there, let him wonder if he can; that the Church there ſhould give theſe Apoſtles ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, affectionate, Chriſtian, dimiſſory valediction. And do but think how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as well as how dangerous, how difficult and how neceſſary the converſion of ſo many heathen nations by two perſons contemptible in the eyes of the world, muſt needs ſeem to be, and then judge it ſtrange, if you can, that the <hi>Antiochians</hi> ſhould faſt and pray with all earneſtneſs for the concurrence of Gods grace with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which alone could enable them to accompliſh ſuch an unlikely work. Surely here is reaſon enough for all that was done, though reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and publike allowance never came in their thoughts. Thus having ſhewed you what were probably, yea certainly the ends of that faſting, and prayer, and impoſition of hands; I now come to ſhew that publike allowance, or currant repute was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the end intended thereby.

<list>
                           <item>1. Such eminent Apoſtles ſtood in no need at all of eſteem to be procured by the <hi>Antiochians,</hi>

                           </item>
                           <item>2. If the Apoſtles had need, yet inferiours ſeem to be utterly uncapable to add eſteem to Superiours; obſcure and private perſons to famous Apoſtles.</item>
                           <item>3. If the Apoſtles had gone to other Churches where the <hi>Antiochians</hi> were better known then they, in that caſe I confeſs the <hi>Antiochians</hi> might have added ſomething; but ſith they go to the blind Heathens in very remote countries, that it may be, had never heard of the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> or if they had, it is like never regarded it, except to revile and reproach it, and therefore how can we imagine that the <hi>Antiochians</hi> ſeparation could add any thing to the Apoſtles eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</item>
                           <item>4. If the Apoſtles had need of eſtimation, they could procure it to themſelves by their admirable Doctrine, and unheard of miracles, yea they were much more likely by their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious miracles to add to the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> then the <hi>Antiochians</hi> at all to them.</item>
                           <item>5. How can we think an ordination at <hi>Antioch,</hi> or anywhere elſe, is a likely <hi>medium</hi> to create
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35882:53"/>eſteem for the Apoſtles in <hi>Paphos, Lycaonia, Iconium,</hi> or ſuch like blockiſh Countries or Cities, where it is like neither the <hi>quid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> nor <hi>quid rei</hi> of ordination was ever known until they were told them by the Apoſtles!</item>
                           <item>6. If the Gentiles had ever heard of an ordination before, yet how little did they eſteem of it? and unlikely to add eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to others is an action not eſteemed it ſelf: do not we ſee even in <hi>England,</hi> that a mans parts and gifts, his holy life, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labours add more to his eſtimation then ordination it ſelf?</item>
                           <item>7. How can we imagine that <hi>Paul</hi> would take an ordination from men to add to his eſteem,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.1, 11, 12.</note> when he plainly denies any ordination from men, as a thing that would undervalue him?</item>
                           <item>8. Had the procuring of eſtimation been their end, then would they much rather have uſed let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of recommendation, which the very light of nature (as well as Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1.) ſhews us and all nations to be the moſt proper <hi>medium,</hi> as appears by the practice of all Nations in ſending their Credentials and Teſtimonials with their Ambaſſadors.</item>
                           <item>9. What need <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> be reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to prove eſtimation among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles beyond ſeas? for they had no more perſonal knowledge of the laſt ordination
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35882:54"/>then of the firſt, and might have been as well certified by the <hi>Antiochians</hi> of the firſt ordination, as of the laſt; yea and much better, by how much the immediate Call was more famous and wonderful then the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate.</item>
                           <item>10. If <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſuffered a reordination to create them eſteem in a far country, then by the ſame reaſon may a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, when he removes into a ſtrange country, admit a reordination to advance his local eſtimation, and ſo, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> then which what is more unheard of? Neither could this reordination be to create eſteem among the Jews; for they were not ſent to the Jews, but to the Gentiles; and they had great eſteem among the Jews before, as appears by their reception, adminiſtration, and valediction; and beſides <hi>Paul</hi> looked upon it among the Jews as an undervaluing, to be accounted <hi>an Apoſtle of man, or by man,</hi> &amp;c.</item>

               <p>By all which I hope it appears, that in this Text is held forth no reordination, to procure eſtimation.

And if ſo, then how many wayes

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Drawn from the ſuppoſed iterability of marriage. Thus Mr. <hi>H.</hi> p. 37. <hi>So is marriage an entrance into the conjugal ſtate. Suppoſe a couple married only by the Magiſtrate, and as to ſome conſiderable effect their marriage is in queſtion, who would doubt, but upon ſuch or any ſerious cauſe for it, they may be married again by the book of Common-Prayer? And why not upon this very reaſon? Becauſe there is nothing elſe in it, but that that form, which is compiled in the book, for the entring, or (which is the truth) ſignifying the entrance of two perſons into wedlock, is now uſed to ſignifie theſe to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35882:55"/>be entred, or confirming them legally in that eſtate, which it will do as well as enter them at firſt; who will ſay it is a ſin or tranſgreſſion to uſe it ſo? A great piece of matter and miſuſage is it not? Apply the fame here,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſol.</hi> 1. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the formal contract, and the ſolemnity of marriage, and ſo I anſwer: 1. The formal contract, or marriage, in its eſſential is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterable, as Argument 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Marriage in its eſſentials is but a civil contract (as I ſuppoſe) but ordination is a religious, and therefore we may be more bold in the caſe of marriage, then in the caſe of ordination.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though marriage <hi>in genere</hi> be Gods Ordinance, yet <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> I conceive, it hath no divine inſtitution in any poſitive Law, neither hath the ſolemnity; and hereupon there is a latitude, and upon this latitude marriage <hi>in ſpecie</hi> is become an humane Ordinance, which we may be ſomewhat more bold with, as I ſaid before; but now ordination <hi>in ſpecie</hi> is a divine Ordinance, inſtituted in Gods poſitive Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are incomparably tied up, then if there were no ſuch inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The formal contract, which gives the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35882:56"/>relation, may be, and often is before the ſolemnity in marriage; but not ſo, I conceive, in ordination; for though God hath ſaid of the miniſterial honour, <hi>No man taketh this honour to himſelf;</hi> yet he hath never ſaid of conjugal honour, No man taketh this honour to himſelf, but rather the contrary. And though a man might not take this office to himſelf, if no Law of the Land ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him, yet (for ought I know) a man might take a wife to himſelf, if the Law did not forbid him. So that the repetition of marriage is not the repetition of the proper formal contract, but of the ſolemnity; but not ſo in ordination.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The proper end of the marriage ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity is the ſatisfaction of the world; and therefore if the firſt ſolemnity give not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, the proper end of marriage ſeems to require a repetition; and hence it is, that there is no prophanation of the Name of God. But now ordination, as it is not a meer ſolemnity, ſo its proper end is not the ſatisfaction of the world, but to inveſt with miniſterial power, which end is certainly attained in the firſt ordination, and therefore its repetition muſt needs be a taking Gods Name in vain.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Suppoſe that ſuch a repetition of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

Yea more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is very obſervable, that the very reaſon of this ſo great diverſity, was their deteſtation of rebaptization. I find theſe ten ſeveral interpretations, none of which allow a repetition of every way the ſame baptiſme, which therefore cannot ſupport the repetition of the ſame ordination.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Others ſay, that baptiſme may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alwayes Metaphorically in that Tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Others ſuppoſe, that the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> is to be taken Metaphorically for the doctrine, and the baptiſme of Chriſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and ſo, that theſe twelve were but once baptized, and that not by <hi>John,</hi> but <hi>Paul.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. Others take baptiſme properly in both; but yet obſerve that both theſe expreſſions relate to <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme; and

               <p n="7">7. Others take baptiſme properly in both, and acknowledge a rebaptization; but it was becauſe thoſe Diſciples wanted the true baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> and had only a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt adminiſtration from ſome of <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples, wanting the true form, being not in the name of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Others acknowledge a rebaptization, but it was through this accidental corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the adminiſtration of <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm, the baptized being not inſtructed in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, and of Chriſts baptiſm with the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Others acknowledge a rebaptization, but erroneouſly adminiſtred by ſome of <hi>Pauls</hi> Diſciples before <hi>Paul</hi> came to them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That <hi>Paul</hi> did indeed rebaptize whom <hi>John</hi> had baptized, but it was becauſe Chriſts baptiſm and <hi>Johns</hi> were not the ſame: And this way goes the Council at <hi>Trent, Bellarmine, Eſtius à Lap.</hi> and (I think I may ſafely ſay) the Romaniſts generally; and if I ſhould add the Ancients alſo, I ſhould not be much overtasked to prove it; and this way <hi>Diodat.</hi> himſelf ſeems to go. And now I infer, If any of theſe interpretations may be allowed, or if the uniform conſent
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35882:62"/>and practice of the Catholick Church may be admitted, then is our reverend Brother miſtaken in his interpretation. And oh how ſtrong and ſubtile was that temptation, that trapan'd ſo learned a perſon into the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of one novelty by another, reordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by rebaptization? And what cauſe have I, and ſuch as I, to pour out our ſouls in that petition, <hi>Lead us not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But hold, I muſt not ſit down as yet, there is another job of work behind, and that is to ſaw aſunder the Argument for this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular opinion; and which is more difficult to reſolve, amongſt all theſe Divines, whoſe hand-ſaw to uſe; to uſe them all at once is needleſs, if not impoſſible; to reject any out of our ſhop, is prodigal, if not ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: and therefore I will only make uſe of one, and let the reſt lye by until I have more need of them. I ſhall not now deny Chriſts baptiſm and <hi>Johns</hi> to be the ſame, but ſhall rather conject ure that <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm was never iterated; and therefore I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to anſwer the Argument for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

And doth not the name Meſſiah ſignifie Chriſt? <hi>John</hi> 1.41. And can we think that <hi>John</hi> underſtood it not? Again, the Angel having told <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> that their bleſſed Babes name ſhould be <hi>Jeſus, Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.31. And the b'eſſed Virgin being Couzen to <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, Johns</hi> Mother, and going to viſit her, and continuing with her three moneths, and conferring with her with the greateſt mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual joy concerning the holy feed, is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that all this while the bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> did not tell her Couzen of her Childs name? And if <hi>Mary</hi> told <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> how is it probable that <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſo good a Mother, would not tell her ſon <hi>John?</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it being about thirty years ſpace (as is conjectured) betwixt the giving the name Jeſus unto Chriſt, and the preaching of <hi>John,</hi> is it probable, that all this while <hi>John</hi> did never hear Chriſts name, <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being his Kinſman, and his ſingular fore-runner. By this, I ſuppoſe, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35882:64"/>that <hi>John</hi> did know the names, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Exegeſis</hi> might be his; but if it were not, it will not infer, that the perſons ſpoken of were not <hi>Johns</hi> hearers. Thus having enervated the Argument for rebaptization; give me leave to add a few conſiderations to evince the contrary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If <hi>Paul</hi> repeated the ſame baptiſm, how doth he ſay, <hi>There is one baptiſm, Eph.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the ſame baptiſm may be repeated; how ſhall we gain-ſay the Anabaptiſts?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If baptiſm may be repeated, then may the thing ſignified by baptiſm (<hi>viz.</hi> the new birth, or entrance into the Church) be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, but that is impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Calvin</hi> argues thus, <hi>Quod ſi priorem baptiſmum ignorantia vitiat, ut ſit altero baptiſmo corrigendus, primi omnium rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zandi erant Apoſtoli, quitoto poſt baptiſmum ſuum triennio vix modicam ſyncerioris do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinae particulam deguſtaverant, &amp;c.</hi> This Argument will hold good upon a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral accouns, as well as upon this ſpecial.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our Engliſh Annotators on this Text argue from the oneneſs of circumciſion, to the oneneſs of baptiſm; and ſo doth learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Wallaeus de baptiſmo.</hi>

                  <hi>R.</hi> The acts of Chriſt in order to the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary perpetual Apoſtleſhip of theſe twelve were various.
<list>
                     <item>1. Chriſt cals them to be his Diſciples, and declares to ſome of them his purpoſe to make them Miniſters: <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.18, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.10.</item>
                     <item>2. Theſe being diſcipled, Chriſt cals twelve of them to him, and points them out to be Apoſtles, but doth not as yet (I conceive) impower them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.10.11. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.13.</item>
                     <item>3. Theſe twelve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen out to be his Apoſtles, he gives them a particular temporary commiſſion to preach and work wonders, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.1, 7.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35882:65"/>
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.1.</item>
                     <item>4. Chriſt declares upon occaſion what full power he will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards give unto them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19.</item>
                     <item>5. He gives them their full Commiſſion at laſt to preach both to Jews and Gentiles, <hi>i. e.</hi> to all the world, and to continue by themſelves and ſucceſſors to the end of the world, and perfection of his Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.22. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.21, 22, 23. <hi>Epheſs.</hi> 4.8.13.</item>
                  </list>
So then here I fix, That it ſeems moſt probable that the Apoſtles had not their plenary perpetual commiſſion till after Chriſts reſurrection, and that what they had before, was both temporary, and particular, limited only to the Jews. And this I ſhall endeavour to confirm. 1. This Commiſſion (<hi>Mat.</hi> 10.7.) was to laſt but for a time,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.7.</note> appears,
<list>
                     <item>1. Becauſe the work that they were then impowered to, <hi>was to preach that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> And therefore it ſhould ſeem that when the kingdom of God was come, that is the Goſpel-Church, that their power ſhould then ceaſe. <hi>Calvin in locum, Hoc eſt quod dixi praeconium quo crigi populi animos voluit Chriſtus in ſpem propiuquae redemptionis.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Becauſe the full meaſures of the ſpirit were not given till after Chriſts reſurrection, and therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, not that full power which ſuppoſed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35882:66"/>thoſe full gifts.</item>
                     <item>3. Becauſe this former ſending forth is expreſsly ſaid to be for a journey,<note place="margin">Mat. 10, 9, 10.</note> for which journey they ſhould provide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</item>
                     <item>4. Becauſe Chriſt tels them they ſhould not be able to perform their journey,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.23.</note> and their work before the Son of man be come.</item>
                     <item>5. Becauſe the Apoſtles not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were ſent forth, gathered themſelves together,<note place="margin">Mar. 6.30.</note> and return to their Maſter to give an account of their work.</item>
                     <item>6. Doth not Chriſt lay ſuch a foundation for their laſt Commiſſion, which ſeems to imply that their former commiſſion was not full. Obſerve our Lords words, <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 28.21, 22.</note>

Not unlike is that <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8, 9. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> ſaith, Mathaeus <hi>vero antequam diſcipulis injunctum narret docendi munus, Chriſtum de ſua poteſtate praefatum eſſe dicit, nec absre; non enim hic ſufficerit mediocris authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas — non enim aeternam potentiam jactat qua praeditus fuit ante creatum mundum, ſed,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35882:66"/>quam nunc accepit, dum ordinatus fuit mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Judex; immo notandum eſt imperium hoc non fuiſſe liquido cognitum donec à mortuis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furrexit.</hi> Muſculus dialogues thus, <hi>Quis ille mittens eſt?</hi> Mat. <hi>ult. dicit,</hi>

                        <hi>Data eſt mihi omnis poteſtas in coelo &amp; in terra; quibus dictis, ſubjungit, Euntes ergo docete,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>7. When Chriſt gave his Apoſtles a perpetual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he expreſſeth its perperuity,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.22.</note> 
                        <hi>I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> mentions this commiſſion, he expreſly mentions its perpetuity thus, <hi>Till we all come to the unity of the faith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4.13.</note> &amp;c. but in the former intimations of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionating his Apoſtles, there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any perpetuity; as if the Holy Ghoſt did purpoſely put this difference betwixt them. So then were our former ordinations but temporary, as the Apoſtles firſt commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then could we admit a ſecond upon expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the firſt: but ſith ours was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to a perpetual office, therefore theſe Texis cannot warrant any reordination in our caſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This former commiſſion of the Apoſtles was but particular, limited only to the Jews;<note place="margin">Mat. 10.5, 6.</note> and this limitation was not of their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, but of their power, as appears from the commiſſion it ſelf, <hi>Go not in the way of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35882:67"/>the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. and likewiſe from their latter commiſſion,<note place="margin">Mar. 12.28.</note> which runs thus, <hi>Diſciple me all nations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> &amp;c. So that hence we may obſerve this difference betwixt theſe two commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the former was limited to the Jews, with an expreſs exception againſt the Gentiles; but the later expreſly to both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: So then had our former ordination been to a private place, with an expreſs limitation to go nowhither elſe, then indeed upon our removal to the excepted place, there would be need of a new Commiſſion as well as with the Apoſtles; but our ordination was to the whole work of a Presbyter in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, without any limitation in our commiſſion to a particular Pariſh, County, Nation or People: therefore this inſtance neither as an inſtance, nor from the reaſon of the thing, can juſtifie our reordination. And to prevent the cenſure of ſingularity in this interpretation,<note place="margin">In Mat. 10. &amp;c.</note> obſerve what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Notandam tamen eſt de perpetuo Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latu nondum haberi ſermonem, ſed tantum de praeconio temporali — Nunc ergo mittuntur, ut in Judaea tempus adeſſe promiſſae inſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis, &amp; ſalutis nuntient.

               <p n="6">6. What a lamentable blow would the nullifying of Presbyterian ordination give unto the Church of God, eſpecially the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches? it is well known that in the Reformed Churches their ordination is but Presbyterial; no not any better in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> or thoſe other countries where they have Superintendents; for thoſe Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have all their authority under Chriſt from the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> and <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> without any Dioceſans at all. And moreover ſome of thoſe Churches when they had Biſhops, caſt them out, and others when they were offered, refuſed them: yet it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in how great concord we have lived with them ſince the Reformation; and thoſe that do now diſown them, I would have them ſpeak out that the world may know them. Further, if the want of Prelatical ordination will unchurch us, then greater faults will unchurch a people much more; and then what will become both of the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches?</p>

Not many of the people; for its moſt certain, that a huge number of the ſober people of this nation are much ſaded at the loſs of thoſe faithful Miniſters that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not to reordination, and no ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſaded at thoſe that ſubmit; fearing that
